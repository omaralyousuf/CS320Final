How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
As a developer, I  should automate my process to make security best practices easier to adopt. 
The goal is to fix flaws during the natural flow of development, rather than conduct security scans only at the end of the process.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
To incorporate user needs into a program we need to engage in a process where users understand their problems, processes, goals, and preferences.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software with a "Bottom-up" approach where the design starts with the lowest level components and subsystems. 
This approach can be used to hide the low-level details of implementation and be merged with the top-down technique.
